Export script for exporting a single set from [deckbox.org](https://deckbox.org) to a csv file. I'm providing this as-is - this is only intended for my own use, since I'm paranoid about losing my catalog.

## Setup

1. Clone this
2. `npm install`
3. Set values in **config.json** as needed.
4. `node deckbox-export.js`, output will be written to the deckbox-chosen filename inside the export directory you set in config.json.
